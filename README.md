# fare-comparison
This GitHub is our code for our Uber and Lyft comparison website.
At this website, and using this code you will be able to compare prices between Uber and Lyft. 
This was made at Google CSSI by a group of three. 
We were able to accomplish this goal within 4 days, and then present this to Google Software Engineers. 
Thanks Anthony and Parisha hope to see you all again soon!
