# fare-comparison
This GitHub is our code for our Uber and Lyft comparison website.
At this website, and using this code you will be able to compare prices between Uber and Lyft. 
This was made at Google CSSI by a group of three. 
We were able to accomplish this goal within 4 days, and then present this to Google Software Engineers. 
Thanks Anthony and Parisha hope to see you all again soon!

Good luck everyone interested in attending Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. You will have a long, but very fun journey ahead of you. I hope you all have a great time there like we did, but I also hope you guys get just as much if not more of a challenge than we recieved.
